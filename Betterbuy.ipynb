{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Better Buy: A Stock Joint-Analysis and Comparison Tool\n\"Better Buy\" is an interactive tool I've created that performs joint analysis and comparisons of two tech companies' business strategies, stock performances, and growth opportunities and recommends the better stock to investors. This model also provides users with detailed visualizations of key growth, performance, and risk metrics to base their decisions.\n\n\"Better Buy\" consists of highly-detailed implementations of business and technical analysis strategies for both growth and value-driven investors. The tool's analytics capabilities rely on a number of scripts I've written totally from scratch.\n\nMy tool also uses pandas and numPy for in-depth analysis, as well as matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. I've also imported the yfinance library to access historical stock quotes.\n\nFor this Notebook, I will be using my model to compare the two major fintech payment companies: Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL).\n\nEach of the four major sections (Business Strategy, Financial Strength & Growth, Risk vs. Return, and Valuation) will begin with a series of guided questions which serve as subtopics for my analysis.\n\nBusiness Strategy\nWhat is the customer base behind each company and how effectively does each leverage this base? What is the historical reputation of each company and its business model in the context of industry? How does each company's organizational structure and recent M&A history affect its appearance to investors? What are some current developments headed by each company and how well do they capitalize on AI? What are some opinions of each company's operational directions as held by shareholders and client businesses?\n\nStock Risk & Return Analysis\nWhat was the moving average of our stocks? What was the daily return average of a stock? What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks? How much value do we put at risk by investing each company's stock?\n\nHow can we attempt to predict future stock behavior, especially in market and industry context?\n\nFinancial Strength & Growth\nThis section utilizes 10-K and 10-Q filings from SEC's public EDGAR database. I've written a script that parses raw XML data from company filings and converts them into workable Pandas dataframes."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\nimport sys\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Choosing company, file version, and date\nfile = '10-Q'\nend = '20191231'\ncik1 = '0001512673' #Square\ncik2 = '0001633917' #PayPal\nxmlList1 = []\nxmlList2 = []\nxmlList1.append('https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000151267319000011/q2fy19squareinc10-q_htm.xml')\nxmlList2.append('https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391719000180/pypl10-qq22019_htm.xml')\n\nurl = \"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK={}&type={}&dateb={}\"\nurlstr1 = requests.get(url.format(cik1, file, end)).text\nurlstr2 = requests.get(url.format(cik2, file, end)).text\n\n# Loop through files separated by year\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(urlstr1, 'html.parser')\ntable = soup.find('table', class_='tableFile2')\nrows = table.find_all('tr')\nfor row in rows:\n    cells = row.find_all('td')\n    if len(cells) > 3:\n        #Parsing all suitable XML files\n        if '2017' or '2018' or '2019' in cells[3].text:\n            html = 'https://www.sec.gov' + cells[1].a['href']\n            htmlstr = requests.get(html).text\n            soup = BeautifulSoup(htmlstr, 'html.parser')\n            table = soup.find('table', class_='tableFile', summary='Data Files')\n            rows = table.find_all('tr')\n            for row in rows:\n                cells = row.find_all('td')\n                if len(cells) > 3:\n                    xmlink = 'https://www.sec.gov' + cells[2].a['href']\n                    xmlList1.append(xmlink)\n                    break   \nsoup = BeautifulSoup(urlstr2, 'html.parser')\ntable = soup.find('table', class_='tableFile2')\nrows = table.find_all('tr')\nfor row in rows:\n    cells = row.find_all('td')\n    if len(cells) > 3:\n        #Parsing all suitable XML files\n        if '2017' or '2018' or '2019' in cells[3].text:\n            html = 'https://www.sec.gov' + cells[1].a['href']\n            htmlstr = requests.get(html).text\n            soup = BeautifulSoup(htmlstr, 'html.parser')\n            table = soup.find('table', class_='tableFile', summary='Data Files')\n            rows = table.find_all('tr')\n            for row in rows:\n                cells = row.find_all('td')\n                if len(cells) > 3:\n                    xmlink = 'https://www.sec.gov' + cells[2].a['href']\n                    xmlList2.append(xmlink)\n                    break","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What are the historical revenues and opearting income growth of each company?\nWe'll first analyze revenue growth of each company, segmented into domestic/international as well as by revenue type, such as subscription-based, transaction-based, and Bitcoin-based.\n\nNext, I'll compare each company's revenue with operating income in order to compute each company's operating margin trend and assess their underlying business risks.
